//! Gate precedence — `resolveGate` + `applyGate` ported from `gate.mjs` (ADR-0003).
//!
//! Orchestration owns the *transition*; governance owns the *verdict*. The gate is a verdict
//! CONSUMER, never an author. It consumes an wicked-apps-core [`ConformanceClaim`], persists the verdict
//! as the phase's `gate_decision` (the HARD veto marker), and resolves the transition through the
//! single-writer [`crate::reducer`]:
//!
//! | claim decision                | phase resolves to            |
//! |-------------------------------|------------------------------|
//! | `Deny` (hard)                 | `Rejected` (approve blocked) |
//! | `AllowWithConditions`         | `ApprovedWithConditions` (+obligations) |
//! | `Allow`                       | `Approved`                   |
//! | no claim                      | stays `GateRunning` (NEVER silent-approve) |
//!
//! NOTE on the decision vocabulary: the prototype's verdict strings were
//! `deny | reject | allow_with_conditions | allow`. The wicked-apps-core [`Decision`] type — the verified
//! gate input this crate is built against — collapses the hard-veto case to a single `Deny` variant
//! (there is no separate `Reject`). The hard-veto branch therefore keys on `Decision::Deny`; the
//! ADR's `reject ⇒ ¬approved` invariant is enforced on that variant.
